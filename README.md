# Moonrise Toolbox

**Tools and scrips for common tasks in Unity development.**

The Moonrise Toolbox is a vast collection of utilities for Unity development.
It is designed to speed up and simplify the development of single A games, by providing abstractions and solutions for many common tasks.

### Some Highlights

A minimal audio system simplifying the playback and management of sound effects.

A minimal localization system to translate strings and UI text.

An animation system for creating simple animations from code.

A messaging system for event based communication between game components.

An extended gizmo drawing utility.

The generation of smooth curves and Bezier paths.

A tasking solution simplifying the use of coroutines for common tasks.

### Further Notes

The library currently does not have documentation.
Tools can be found by browsing the package structure which groups scripts by feature.
I'm happy to answer any questions or add documentation if there is any demand.
